The steps that I followed are - 


1) In the first step, which is that of object detection, I did it through color recognition method. I detected the the object by assigning yellow colour numpy array

2) In the second step, I created the code for Kalman filter

3) In third steps, I created the code which computes mesaured, calculated and actal distance
