To do the object detection I have used Mask R-CNN model. Explanation of code is as follows -

1)  For loading and saving models and weights, I first installed 2.10.0 version of h5py

2)  For functioning of the model, downgradation of tensorflow was necessary, so I downgraded the tensorflow model to version 1.x

3)  I then git cloned mask_RCNN

4) I then overrided some parameters in model.py file.

5) I then installed rest of the libraries required for the code

6) Then I got cloned the COCO dataset from https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git

7) I then imported all the other neccesary libraries ( matplotlib, numpy etc. ) along with other python files, (mrcc.model etc). I provided a path for the root directory.
 And then loaded the trained model file - mask_rcnn_coco.h5.
 
 8) I then imported the video on which we have to perform ball object detection
 
 9) I saved the video in the next cell
 
 10) I then wrote the function for putting a mask on detected object, putting accuracy and scores around bounding box etc.
 
 11) Then I write down the function to divide the video into individual images and do the object detection on individual images.
 
 12) I then saved the images in the roort directory
 
 13) Then, I created the function to create the video which will combine all those frames, where object has been detected.
 
 14) Then, I saved the videos in the root directory
 
 15) Then I downloaded the video
 
 16) I then repested the same steps for the second video
