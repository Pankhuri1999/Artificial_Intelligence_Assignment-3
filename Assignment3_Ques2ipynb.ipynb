        "To do the object detection I have used Mask R-CNN model. Explanation of code is as follows -\n",

        "1)  For loading and saving models and weights, I first installed 2.10.0 version of h5py\n",
        "\n",
        "2)  For functioning of the model, downgradation of tensorflow was necessary, so I downgraded the tensorflow model to version 1.x\n",
        "\n",
        "3)  I then git cloned mask_RCNN\n",
        "\n",
        "4) I then overrided some parameters in model.py file.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) I then installed rest of the libraries required for the code\n",

        "6) Then I got cloned the COCO dataset from https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git\n",
        "\n",
        "7) I then imported all the other neccesary libraries ( matplotlib, numpy etc. ) along with other python files, (mrcc.model etc). I provided a path for the root directory.\n",

        " 9) I saved the video in the next cell\n",
        " \n",
        " 10) I then wrote the function for putting a mask on detected object, putting accuracy and scores around bounding box etc.\n",
        " \n",
        " 11) Then I write down the function to divide the video into individual images and do the object detection on individual images.\n",
        " \n",
        " 12) I then saved the images in the roort directory\n",
        " \n",
        " 13) Then, I created the function to create the video which will combine all those frames, where object has been detected.\n",
